            <h2>🔄 Time to Flip the Power Dynamic</h2>
            <p>Tired of always being the one to text first? Sick of chasing women who barely respond? This 10-step strategy will psychologically condition her to start reaching out to you first. The hunter becomes the hunted.</p>

        <div class="power-shift">
            <h3>⚡ The Power Shift</h3>
            <p>When you flip the script correctly, she starts wondering why you haven't texted, checking her phone for your messages, and eventually breaking down and reaching out first. Welcome to relationship leverage.</p>

            <div class="step-content">
                Before you can flip any script, you need to establish that you're worth chasing. You can't create scarcity around something that isn't valuable. Build attraction and investment before you pull back.

                <h4>🧠 The Psychology</h4>
                <p>Scarcity only works when there's established value. If you withdraw attention before creating any attraction or investment, you're just another guy who disappeared. She needs to care about losing you first.</p>

                    <li>Share interesting stories and experiences</li>
                    <li>Show genuine interest in her thoughts and opinions</li>
                    <li>Be the guy who makes her laugh and feel understood</li>
